You're absolutely right to question these numbers! 🚨 These returns are indeed unrealistically high and there are several critical factors explaining
why:

🔍 MAJOR REALITY CHECK - Why These Numbers Are Unrealistic

1. Missing Real-World Trading Costs 💸

❌ MISSING FROM BACKTEST:
• Spreads: ~0.1-0.3 pips per trade (EURUSD)
• Commission: ~$3-7 per lot per trade
• Slippage: 0.1-0.5 pips in normal conditions
• Overnight swap fees: Daily rollover costs
• Broker margin requirements: 30:1 to 500:1 leverage limits

2. Unrealistic Trade Execution Assumptions ⚡

❌ BACKTEST ASSUMES PERFECT CONDITIONS:
• Instant fills at exact prices (impossible in reality)
• No requotes or execution delays
• Perfect stop loss execution (often slips 1-3 pips)
• No weekend gaps or market closures
• Unlimited liquidity at all price levels

3. Micro-Scalping on M1 Timeframe 📊

Looking at your results:

- 4,987 trades in ~7 months = ~23 trades per day
- Average win: $12.01, Average loss: $8.81
- This is micro-scalping - extremely sensitive to transaction costs

4. Mathematical Reality Check 🧮

REALISTIC COST ANALYSIS:
• 4,987 trades × 0.2 pip spread × $50/pip (0.5 lot) = $49,870 in spread costs
• Your profit: $49,386
• NET RESULT: Nearly breakeven or loss after spread alone!

5. Market Impact Not Considered 🌊

❌ REAL TRADING ISSUES:
• Order book depth limitations
• Price impact from larger orders
• Broker hedging delays
• Network latency (50-200ms delays)
• Market volatility during news events

🎯 What These Results Actually Show

✅ POSITIVE TAKEAWAYS:

1. Strategy Logic Works: RSI mean reversion + trailing stops show edge
2. Risk Management Effective: Good win rates, controlled drawdowns
3. System Architecture Sound: Modular design is professional

❌ UNREALISTIC ELEMENTS:

1. Profit Magnitude: 493% in 7 months is impossible consistently
2. Transaction Frequency: 23 trades/day unsustainable with costs
3. Perfect Execution: Real world has friction everywhere

📋 To Make This Realistic, You'd Need:

Immediate Adjustments:

# Add realistic costs to backtest:

spread_cost = 0.0002 _ contract_size _ lot_size # 2 pip spread
commission = 7.0 # $7 per lot round trip
slippage = 0.0001 _ contract_size _ lot_size # 1 pip slippage

total_cost_per_trade = spread_cost + commission + slippage

# Subtract from each trade P&L

Strategy Modifications:

1. Higher Timeframes: H1 or H4 instead of M1
2. Larger Profit Targets: 10-20 pips minimum to overcome costs
3. Fewer Trades: Quality over quantity
4. Risk Per Trade: 1-2% account risk maximum

🎯 Realistic Expectations

Good Forex Strategy Benchmarks:

- Annual Return: 20-50% (exceptional: 100%)
- Max Drawdown: 5-15%
- Win Rate: 45-65%
- Profit Factor: 1.3-2.0
- Trades per Month: 10-50 (not 600+)

💡 Next Steps Recommendation

1. Add Transaction Costs: Implement realistic spread/commission model
2. Test Higher Timeframes: Try H1 or H4 data
3. Adjust Parameters: Larger profit targets, fewer trades
4. Paper Trade First: Test with demo account including all costs
5. Start Small: If moving to live, use micro lots initially

The trailing stop system architecture is solid - the issue is the micro-scalping frequency makes it unrealistic with real trading costs. This is a
common backtesting trap! 🪤
